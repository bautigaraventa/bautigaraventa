💡 Since day one, I’ve been passionate about **building products that matter** — and moving fast to make them happen.

I’ve worked in both **big companies** and **small teams**, and I know for sure:  
👉 I thrive in startup environments.

I enjoy:

- Moving fast and shipping often 🚢
- Building things that users actually need 💬
- Collaborating with small, focused teams 🤝
- Making decisions and pushing things forward every day 🚀
